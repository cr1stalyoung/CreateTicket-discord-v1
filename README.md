*** Support system for discord ***

Description:
Full-fledged support code for the discord server. The disnake library is used, as well as a database for storing active tickets - sqlite. In the future, it is better to migrate to postgreSQL.  

If you have a question about the code, you can ask it in our Discord: https://discord.gg/2hdu3RjaTH
